            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF Sir <hi>THOMAS PILKINGTON,</hi> Kt. (Now Lord Mayor of <hi>LONDON</hi>) Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> Kt. deceaſed; <hi>Slingisby Bethell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Henry Corniſh,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> deceas'd; <hi>Samuel Shute,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd; <hi>Samuel Swynock, John Deagle, Francis Jenkes,</hi> deceas'd; <hi>Richard Freeman, John Jekyll, Robert Kaye</hi> and <hi>John Wickam,</hi> all now, or late Citizens of <hi>London;</hi> as to the Riot pretended to be committed by them in the Election of Sheriffs in the Year 1682.</head>
            <p>IT is an undoubted Truth, That nothing ſtood more in the way of the Tyrannical and Popiſh Intereſt, than the Liberties and Privileges of the City of <hi>London;</hi> and amongſt thoſe Liberties and Privileges, the Power of Electing Sheriffs for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> was that which chiefly obſtructed their Malicious and Wicked Deſigns; and for that reaſon, their Principal Contrivance was, to ſubvert and deſtroy ſuch Right of Election, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in a ſhameleſs and impudent manner, whereby the Strength
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135577:2"/>of the Conſpiracy may appear, but not the leaſt ſhew of Candor or Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The Election of Sheriffs for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and of many other Officers, belongs to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> in Common-Hall aſſembled; and Elections have always been, or ought to have been made by the Majority of the Common-Hall: And when a Poll hath been demanded on the behalf of any in competition, it ought to be granted; and the Lord Mayor cannot by Proclamation, or otherwiſe, diſmiſs or diſſolve the Common-Hall before the Poll is finiſhed. And this was found to be the Cuſtom in a time free from Faction, before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Vaughan</hi> by a Jury of Citizens, in an Action upon the Caſe brought by <hi>Mathuſalem Turner,</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Samuel Sterling,</hi> late Lord May or of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as may be ſeen by the Record entred in the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, 23 <hi>Car.</hi> II. <hi>Roll.</hi> 363.</p>
            <p>At a Common-Hall, held the 24th of <hi>June</hi> 1682. a Poll having been begun and continued for ſeveral hours for the Election of Sheriffs for the ſaid City and County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> wherein <hi>Tho. Papillon</hi> and <hi>John Duboys,</hi> Eſqs; and <hi>Dudl. North</hi> and <hi>Ralph Box,</hi> now Sir <hi>Dudl. North</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Box,</hi> were Competiors; the then Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> with divers others in his Company, came from his Houſe to <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> with great Shouts and Huzza's of his Companions, and diſturbed the then Sheriffs in their Proceedings in taking the Poll, and took upon him, contrary to the Cuſtom before-mentioned, to adjourn the Common-Hall before the Poll was finiſhed, and made Proclamation for all People to depart, and ſo went back again in the ſame manner became. And this may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be concluded to be the reſult of the Advice given him by Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins,</hi> then one of the Principal Secretaries of State, who dined with Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> that day, or at leaſt was with him juſt before he came to <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and was a great Adviſer in this Affair, whoſe Opinion Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> (as is ſuppos'd) was pleaſed to take for the obſtruction of the Free Election of Sheriffs, though he knew at the ſame time, the Court had cauſed Proceedings to be had againſt the City by <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> for the deſtruction and ſubverſion not only of this Liberty of Election of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, but alſo of all other the Privileges and Franchiſes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y; and whether Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> did behave himſelf as an honeſt man, and good Citizen, to follow the Advice of an Enemy in a matter of this Conſequence, let all indifferent men judge.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Diſturbance by the Mayor, Sir <hi>Thomas Pilking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (now Lord Mayor) and <hi>Samuel Shute,</hi> Eſquire, being then Sheriffs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135577:3"/>of <hi>London,</hi> and (being adviſed by Eminent Lawyers, and Ancient Cit zens, That the Taking and Adjourning of the Poll did belong unto them, and not unto the Mayor) proceeded in taking the Poll, and finiſhed the ſame in a peaceable manner: upon the caſting up whereof, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> were duly elected Sheriffs for the year enſuing by a very great Majority of above 1100 Voices; for which Proceeding, the ſaid Sheriffs were within ſome ſhort<note place="margin">n="*" <hi>June</hi> 26, 1682.</note> time after committed by the Privy Council to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for a Riot, for the Cauſe aboveſaid, was in 1682. exhibited by Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> then the King's Attorney General, againſt them, and divers other Eminent Citizens. To which Information the ſaid Sheriffs being brought to the Bar by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be bailed, were forced to plead preſently; which they did, <hi>Not guilty;</hi> and Iſſue being thereupon joined, a <hi>Venire facias Jur</hi> was awarded to the Sheriffs, which ought to have been to the Coroner, the Sheriffs being Parties.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> finding that upon a fair Election he could never hope to do the Courts Drudgery, inſiſted, That by his <hi>Prerogative</hi> (as he called it) as Mayor, he had the Choice of one of the Sheriffs; and that he had named Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> as ſuch; and that the Common-Hall muſt confirm his Choice; and that if but One only Voice of all the Common-Hall was given for Sir <hi>Dudley,</hi> it was ſufficient: And that he might have the other Sheriff of the like Qualifications, he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inſiſt, That he had a Negative Voice upon the Election; and He and his Adherents ſo far prevailed upon the Court of Aldermen, that they took upon them to ſet aſide the ſaid Election, and appointed another to be the 5th of <hi>July</hi> following, and ſummoned a Common-Hall for that purpoſe; at which Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> were again duly elected by the like Majority of above 1100 Voices.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Majority, Sir <hi>John Moor</hi> and his Aſſociates had the Confidence to declare Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> and Mr. <hi>Box</hi> (now Sir <hi>Ralph Box</hi>) to be duly elected: Whereupon Sir <hi>Ralph Box</hi> deſiring to be excuſed, choſe rather to pay the uſual Fine, than ſerve in that Office whereunto he was never elected.</p>
            <p>After this, in <hi>September,</hi> another Common-Hall was held for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one Sheriff in the room of Sir <hi>Ralph Box,</hi> at which the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Voices were given for Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois,</hi> as at the former Common-Hall; and yet Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> (whoſe Name we could never learn was ſo much as put to Vote in order to Election) was declared elected by Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> and his Aſſociates, without the leaſt colour of Right or Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:135577:4"/>On the 28th of <hi>September,</hi> Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> and his Adherents (after having filled <hi>Guild-hall</hi> with the Trained Bands, to terrifie ſuch as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their unjuſt Proceedings) cauſed Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Rich</hi> to be ſworn Sheriffs: At which time Mr. <hi>Papillon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dubois</hi> tendred themſelves to be ſworn, but were rejected.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators againſt the Liberties of the City and Nation, laid this as a Ground work to juſtifie what they had ſo unjuſtly done, and to puniſh the moſt Worthy and Active Citizens who oppoſed them in their Deſigns; thereby contriving, That theſe Sheriffs, thus unjuſtly impoſed upon the City, ſhould empannel Juries not only to try the beſt Citizens as Rioters and Malefactors for doing their duty, but alſo all ſuch as had, or ſhould, either in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Middleſex,</hi> ſhew themſelves Engliſh-men in oppoſing the Deſigns of the Court, which tended to the utter deſtruction of our Religion and Liberties. And, to ſpeak truth, from hence, and from unduly impoſing a Lord Mayor a ſhort time after upon the City, may be juſtly dated the Loſs, Ruine, and Miſchief that hath ſince that time enſued in this Nation, not only to the loſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of multitudes in their Lives, Liberties, and Families, but alſo to the great hazard of the utter Extirpation of the Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Engliſh-men.</p>
            <p>It may be remembred by the way, That whenſoever Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> and his Party had occaſion to uſe Councel for the carrying on their Deſigns with ſome ſhew of Law, Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> afterwards Chief-Juſtice, and Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> ſince Lord Chancellor, were the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons adviſed with, and heard before the Court of Aldermen, as to the Legality of Sir <hi>John Moore</hi>'s Actings, &amp;c. when Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> knew well, that the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the City had been brought upon the Advice of the Former, and that the Other had often ſworn the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the City-Liberties, and that Both of them had ſold themſelves to do what miſchief they could to the City and Nation: So that, had not Sir <hi>John Moore</hi> had a deſire to be miſled, he would never have asked or taken Advice from ſuch Men in ſuch a Concern. But to return to the Proceedings in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> upon the Information, where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants found as much Partiality, and as little Juſtice, as in the City.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, 1682. ſeveral Motions were made on the behalf of the Defendents at the <hi>Kings Bench-Bar,</hi> That the <hi>Venire facias Jur'</hi> might be awarded as the Law did direct, (which was to the Coroner): But all the Anſwer that was given, was, That the Defendants were well enough, and had no reaſon to complain, as the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was then awarded; when in truth they knew well, That had the <hi>Venire</hi> been once
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135577:5"/>awarded to the Coroner, he muſt have returned the Jury, and then the Defendants might have expected an indifferent Trial; Mr. <hi>Broome</hi> the Coroner not being in the Conſpiracy for the deſtruction of the Liberties of the City; and the awarding of the <hi>Venire facias</hi> being in all Caſes the Act of the Court, the Court failed of their duty, in not ordering the ſame to be directed to the Coroner, according to Law: And the Law in this particular being well known to every Lawyer, is a ſtrong Argument, That ſuch failure of the Judges in their duty in ſo plain a Caſe, proceeded from <hi>Corruption</hi> rather than <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as will more fully appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term following, ſeveral others of the Defendants pleaded to Iſſue to the ſaid Information; after which the Attorney-General ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Rule of Court to amend the Record as he ſhould think fit. The Defendants moved againſt this Rule, but in vain; and hereupon Mr. Attorney made a ſuggeſtion on the Roll, That Mr. <hi>Pilkington</hi> (now Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Shute,</hi> two of the Defendants, were Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> at <hi>the time of the Plea pleaded;</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, he prays the <hi>Venire facias</hi> may be awarded to the Sheriffs; which was done, and entred upon Record accordingly; and ſo that Iſſue, as to the Sheriffs, was continued to <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term following.</p>
            <p>The Sitting after <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term, a Record and Writ of <hi>Niſi Prius,</hi> returnable in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term following, was brought down to be try'd at <hi>Guild-hall.</hi> Upon calling the Jury, the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Werk,</hi> one of the Defendants, challenged the Array, for that two Knights were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon the Pannel; which Challenge was allowed by the late Chief-Juſtice <hi>Saunders,</hi> and the Trial for that time put off.</p>
            <p>According to the Law, and the Courſe of the Court, that Record and Writ ought to have been returned and filed in the <hi>Crown Office,</hi> and no new <hi>Venire facias</hi> ought to have iſſued out for returning of a new Jury before the firſt day of <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term; and there ought to have been fifteen days at the leaſt between the <hi>Teſte</hi> and Return of ſuch <hi>Venire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias,</hi> otherwiſe the ſame, and all the Proceedings thereupon, ought, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Motion to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> to be quaſhed: Yet notice was given for Trial of the ſaid Cauſe to be had within fourteen days after the beginning of <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term, upon a <hi>Venire facias Jur' Teſte</hi> in <hi>Hillary</hi>-Term before; whereby, if the <hi>Poſtea,</hi> or Record of <hi>Niſi Prius,</hi> wherein the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s Challenge, ſo allowed as aforeſaid, had been filed, it

            <p>After Notice of, and before the Trial, the Defendants by their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel endeavoured ſeveral days to move the Court, That the Writ and Record of <hi>Niſi Prius</hi> laſt mentioned, might be filed, and for a Copy thereof; but could not be heard, by reaſon of Trials at Bar for ſeveral days, that hinder'd it; and thereupon they moved at the Side-Bar, and the Judges bid the Councel move the Court; which could not be done until after the Trial, by reaſon aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>At the Trial, which was the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. before any of the Jury were ſworn, two Challenges to the Array were in due manner made: The one was to this effect, That Sir <hi>Dudley North</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Rich,</hi> who returned the Jury, were not Sheriffs of <hi>London:</hi> The other was, That the matter to be try'd was, <hi>To try Sir</hi> Dudley North<hi>'s Title to the Sheriffwick;</hi> ſhewing in particular, how his Title would be in queſtion: So that it appeared the Jury then return'd was to try, Whether he <hi>had</hi> Title or <hi>not</hi> to be Sheriff.</p>
            <p>The Chief-Juſtice <hi>Saunders</hi> over-ruled both theſe Challenges as fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous: Whereupon the Defendants by their Councel moved him to ſeal their Bill of Exceptions, which they tendred him in Court ready ingroned for that purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he then refuſed to ſeal it, and promiſed to do it at his Chamber, or to that effect.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Trial went on, and the Defendants were found guilty by direction of the ſaid Chief-Juſtice, upon proof made, That ſome of them had continued together after the pretended Adjournment, and Proclamation made by Sir <hi>John Moore,</hi> then Lord Mayor; and that others had been at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> before ſuch Adjournment, and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all was over, the leaſt breach of the Peace not being proved againſt any of them; and, amongſt others, Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> was found guilty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was not preſent <hi>at any time,</hi> at or near <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> when the pretended Ryot was committed.</p>
            <p>Within Two or Three days after this Trial, the Defendants, by Sir <hi>W. Williams,</hi> and Serjeant <hi>Thompſon,</hi> their Councel, made application to the ſaid Chief Juſtice <hi>Saunders,</hi> to Seal the Bill of Exceptions which had been tendered him in Court at the Trial, which he in a great rage refuſed, ſaying. That he was not ſuch a Fool, to put his Seal to that which would ſet aſide all had been done; or to that effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:135577:7"/>The next day the Defendants, by their Councel, moved the Court of <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> That the <hi>Poſtea,</hi> or Record of <hi>Niſi Prius,</hi> upon which the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s Challenge had been allowed, and which was in the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> a Clerk of the <hi>Crown-Office</hi> (who Proſecuted for the King) might be filed; To which, the Judges then Sitting <hi>(viz.)</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Withens,</hi> anſwered, That it had been moved ſeveral times before, but was denied: But upon opening the Cauſe, they acknowledged the Motion to have been reaſonable, if it had been moved before the Trial; and that if it ſhould be now grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it would ſet aſide the Verdict. And then it was told them, That it had been moved before the Trial; But yet the Court would order nothing therein.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the Defendants Councel moved the Lord Keeper <hi>North</hi> for a Writ out of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> to be directed to the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Saunders,</hi> to command him to Seal the ſaid Bill of Exceptions; which he refuſed to grant, although ſuch Writ is the Subjects Right, and is in the Regiſter of Original Writs.</p>
            <p>The Defendants being thus denied the benefit of the Law, were in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term 1683. for this pretended Riot Fined ſeverally, as is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, by Sir. <hi>Tho. Jones,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Withens,</hi> then Judges of the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> were forced by Impriſonment and otherwiſe to pay the ſame.</p>
